# Optimal Design of Open-Channel Cross-Sections with Complex Roughness

## Introduction
This project aims to optimize the design of open-channel cross-sections characterized by complex, irregular shapes. By minimizing the construction cost and ensuring efficient water flow, this research contributes to the field of hydraulic engineering.

## Methods
* **Problem Formulation:** The problem is formulated as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the construction cost while satisfying constraints related to flow conditions.
* **Optimization Algorithms:**
  * **Genetic Algorithm:** A population-based metaheuristic used to search for the optimal solution.
  * **Gradient Descent:** An iterative optimization algorithm that moves in the direction of the steepest descent of a function.
  * **Lagrange Multipliers:** A method used to find the maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.
* **Governing Equations:** The steady-flow equation for channels with complex roughness is derived and used in the optimization process.

## Results
* **Comparison of Methods:** The performance of the genetic algorithm, gradient descent, and Lagrange multipliers is compared in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
* **Optimal Designs:** The optimal channel cross-sections obtained using different methods are presented.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** The sensitivity of the optimal design to variations in input parameters is analyzed.
