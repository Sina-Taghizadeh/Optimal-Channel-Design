## **Optimization of Fluid Flow in Complex Channels**

### **Overview**
This repository contains the code and results for a project aimed at optimizing the design of channels with complex geometries for fluid flow applications. The project leverages computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations coupled with genetic algorithms and gradient-based optimization techniques to identify the optimal channel design.

### **Objectives**
* **Minimize** pressure drop or maximize heat transfer in channels with complex geometries.
* **Compare** the performance of genetic algorithms and gradient-based optimization techniques.
* **Validate** the numerical results against analytical solutions where possible.

### **Methodology**
1. **Geometry generation:** Creating various channel geometries with different roughness parameters.
2. **CFD simulations:** Solving the Navier-Stokes equations to obtain the flow field.
3. **Optimization:** Employing genetic algorithms and gradient-based optimization to find the optimal design parameters.
4. **Results analysis:** Comparing the performance of different optimization techniques and validating the results against analytical solutions.

### **Key Findings**
* **Genetic algorithms** were found to be more robust in exploring the design space but less efficient in terms of computational cost.
* **Gradient-based optimization** was more efficient but could get trapped in local optima.
* The **optimal channel design** was highly dependent on the specific objective function and flow conditions.
* **Comparison with analytical solutions** showed good agreement, validating the numerical results.
